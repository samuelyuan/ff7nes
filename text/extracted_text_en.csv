7	0	83	0	0	You see the\\headlines in the\\Shinra Times?The\\terrorists that\\bombed the #1\\Reactor are based\\somewhere in the\\slums.
7	0	84	0	0	Blowing up a\\Reactor__they sure\\put some thought\\into this one.

7	0	87	64	57	Hey Cloud.You want to look at this\\with me? It's a\\map of the Midgar\\Rail System. I'll\\explain it to you. I like this kind ofstuff. Bombs and\\Monitors__You know,flashy stuff.
7	0	88	64	57	This is a complete\\model of Midgar. A main support\\structure holds theplate up in the\\center, and there\\are other supports built in each\\section. The 8\\reactors provide\\Midgar with\\electricity.At eachcheckpoint an ID\\sensor device is\\set up.It can checkthe ID's and\\backgrounds on\\each and every\\passenger on the\\train by linking itup to the central\\DB at Shinra HQ.\\__Anyone could\\tell that we look\\suspicious, so\\we're using fake\\IDs.
7	0	89	64	57	Speak of the devil.__That light means we're in the ID\\Security check area__When the lights\\go off, you never\\know what kind of\\creeps'll come out.Anyhow we're\\almost back now.
7	0	90	64	50	Look__you can see\\the surface now,\\this city don't\\have no day or\\night.If that plateweren't there__we\\could see the sky.
7	0	91	64	49	A floating city__\\Pretty unsettling\\scenery.
7	0	92	64	50	Huh? Never expect\\to hear that outta\\someone like you__\\You jes' full of\\surprises.\\The upper world__a city on a plate__\\It's cuz of that\\&^#$# 'pizza' that\\the people under-\\neath are sufferin!And the city below\\is full of poluted air. On topa that, the Reactor keeps\\drainin' up all theenergy.
7	0	93	64	49	Then why doesn't\\everyone move onto\\the plate?
7	0	94	64	50	Dunno.Probably 'cuzthey ain't got no\\money.Or, maybe__\\'cuz they love\\their land, no\\matter how\\polluted it gets.
7	0	95	64	49	I know__no one\\lives in the slums\\because they want\\to. It's like this train. It can't runanywhere except\\where its rails\\take it.
7	0	96	64	50	Yo! Get over here,\\all ya!
7	0	97	64	50	This mission was a\\success.But don't\\get lazy now.The\\hard part's still\\to come!Don't y'allbe scared of that\\explosion!'Cause\\the next one's\\gonna be bigger\\than that!Meet backat the hideout!Moveout!

7	2	47	64	49	Thanks.What\\happened?
7	2	48	64	51	When we got back\\from the #5\\reactor,there was\\this weird man.So\\Barret caught him\\and squeezed some\\information out of\\him.
7	2	49	64	49	That's when the\\Don's name popped\\up.
7	2	50	64	51	Right,Don Corneo.\\Barret told me to\\leave the lech\\alone__But\\something's been\\bothering me.
7	2	51	64	49	I see.So You wantedto get the story\\straight from\\Corneo's mouth.
7	2	52	64	51	So I made it here,\\but now I'm in a\\bind.Corneo is\\looking for a\\bride.Everyday,he\\gets 3 girls,\\chooses one of\\them,and then__and,well__Anyway,I haveto be the girl__or\\I'm out for\\tonight.

7	2	56	64	49	No,Aeris!I can't\\have you get\\involved.
7	2	57	64	52	Oh?So it's all\\right for Tifa to\\be in danger?
7	2	58	64	49	No,I don't want\\Tifa in__
7	2	59	64	51	Is it all right?
7	2	60	64	52	I grew up in the\\slums__I'm used to\\danger.

10	0	102	64	49	Inside the reactor we discovered\\creatures created\\by Shinra. Normal\\SODIER members are\\exposed to mako\\But these people\\were exposed to\\high amounts of\\Mako. Sephiroth\\was unlike normal\\members of SOLDIER_
10	0	103	64	49	After realizing he\\may have been made\\the same way as\\those monsters, he\\went into the\\Shinra mansion and\\learned about the\\Cetra and The\\Jenova Project.

10	0	104	64	51	My father__

11	1	37	64	83	Ho Ho Hooo.Nanaki'stribe has\\incredible\\longevity.So you\\see his 48 years\\would only be\\equivalent to say\\that of a 15 or 16\\years old in human\\reckoning.
11	1	38	64	49	15 or 16!?
11	1	39	64	83	He's quiet and verydeep.You thought hewas an adult?
11	1	40	64	53	__grandfather.I\\want to be an\\adult.I want to\\grow up to be able\\to protect you and\\the village.
11	1	41	64	83	Ho Ho Hooo.No\\Nanaki.You can't\\stand on your own\\yet.To do that now\\would destroy you\\in the long run.
11	1	42	64	83	Looking up too muchmakes you lose\\perspective.When\\it's time for this\\planet to die,\\you'll understand\\that you know\\absolutely nothing.
11	1	43	64	49	__When the planet\\dies?
11	1	44	64	83	Ho Ho Hooo.It may\\be tomorrow,or 100\\years from now__Butit's not long off.
11	1	45	64	49	How do you know\\this?
11	1	46	64	83	I hear the cries ofthe Planet.
11	1	47	64	49	What's that?
11	1	48	64	83	The sound of the\\stars in the\\heavens.While this\\goes on,planets areborn,and die.
11	1	49	64	49	What was that?
11	1	50	64	83	Ho Ho Hooo.That wasa scream from this\\planet.Didn't you\\hear it?As if to\\say__I hurt,I\\suffer__
11	1	51	64	53	They have come hereon a journey to\\save the planet.Whydon't you show themyour apparatus?
11	1	52	64	83	I guess it\\wouldn't hurt,come this way!  
11	1	53	64	83	All workings of\\space are entered\\into this 3D model.Eventually__all\\humans die.What\\happens to them\\after they die?The\\body decomposes,andreturns to the\\Planet.That much\\everyone knows.Whatabout their\\consciousness,theirhearts and their\\souls?The soul too\\returns to the\\Planet.And not onlythose of humans,buteverything on this\\Planet.In fact,all\\living things in\\the universe,are\\the same.
11	1	54	64	83	The spirits that\\return to the\\Planet,merge with\\one another and\\roam the Planet.\\They roam,converge,and divide,becominga swell,called the\\Lifestream.\\Lifestream__In\\other words,a path\\of energy of the\\souls roaming the\\Planet.
11	1	55	64	83	Spirit Energy is a\\word that you\\should never\\forget.A new life__children are\\blessed with Spiritenergy and are\\brought into the\\world.Then,the timecomes when they dieand once again\\return to the\\Planet__Of course\\there are\\exceptions,but Thisis the way of the\\world.
11	1	56	64	83	Spirit energy\\makes all things\\Possible.
11	1	57	64	83	Not only living\\things, but also\\allows planets to\\be planets. 
11	1	58	64	49	If the Spirit\\energy is lost,our\\Planet is\\destroyed_?
11	1	59	64	83	Ho Ho Hooo.Spirit\\energy is efficientBECAUSE it exists\\within nature.When\\Spirit energy is\\forcefully\\extracted,and\\manufactured,it\\can't accomplish\\its true purpose.
11	1	60	64	49	You're talking\\about Mako energy,\\right?
11	1	61	64	83	Everyday Mako\\reactors suck up\\Spirit energy,\\diminishing it.\\Spirit energy gets\\compressed in the\\reactors and\\processed into Makoenergy.All living\\things are being\\used up and thrown\\away.In other\\words,Mako energy\\will only destroy\\the Planet__
11	1	62	64	83	The story of the\\planets__and those\\who lived with\\them__You want to\\know more?Then you\\must listen to the\\words of the\\elders.
11	1	63	64	52	I learned a lot.Theelders taught me\\many things.About\\the Cetra__And the\\Promised Land__\\I'm__alone__I'm allalone now__

11	1	66	64	49	Does that mean we\\can't help?

11	1	197	64	55	Well,they came up\\with a Rocket\\Engine.There was somuch experiment\\about the thought\\of going into outerspace.Our dreams\\got bigger and\\bigger.They put a\\major budget into\\it!Finally,they\\completed Shinra\\#26.They chose the\\best pilot in\\Shinra__no,in the\\world__me.I mean,\\come on.

11	1	199	64	55	But,because of thatdumb-ass Shera,the\\launch got messed\\up.That's why they\\become so anal!
11	1	200	64	55	And so,Shinra nixedtheir outer space\\exploration plans.\\After they told me\\how the future was\\Space Exploration\\and got my damn\\hopes up__DAMN\\THEM!
11	1	201	64	55	Then,it was all\\over once they\\found out Mako\\energy was\\profitable.They\\didn't even so muchas look at space\\exploration.Money,\\moola,dinero!My\\dream was just a\\financial number\\for them!Look at\\this rusted Rocket.I was supposed to\\be the first man inspace with this.

12	0	137	0	0	Tape 1: The\\original crisis\\ \\ \\Gast: Camera's\\ready!, Then\\Ifalna, please tellus about the Cetra.Ifalna: 2000 years ago, our ancestors,the Cetra, heard\\the cries of the\\Planet. The first\\ones to discover\\the Planet's wound\\were the Cetra at\\the Knowlespole.\\ \\ \\ \\Gast: Tell us\\Ifalna__where is\\Knowlespole?\\ \\Ifalna: Knowlespolerefers to this\\area. The Cetra\\then began a\\planet-reading.\\ \\ \\ \\Gast: Ifalna, what exactly does\\Planet-reading\\entail?\\Ifalna: __I can't\\explain it very\\well, but it's\\like having a\\conversation with\\the Planet__It saidsomething fell fromthe sky making a\\large wound.\\Thousands of Cetra\\pulled together,\\trying to heal the\\Planet__But, due tothe severity of thewound, it was only able to heal\\itself, over many\\years.\\ \\ \\Gast: Do the\\Ancients,rather,\\the Cetra, have\\special powers to\\heal the Planet?\\ \\ \\ \\Ifalna: No,it's notthat kind of power.The life force of\\all living things\\on this Planet\\becomes the energy.The Cetra tried\\desperately to\\cultivate the land so as not to\\diminish the neededenergy__\\Gast: Hmm, even\\here so close to\\the North Cave, thesnow never melts.\\Is that because theplanet's energy is gathered here to\\heal its injury?\\Ifalna: Yes, the\\energy that was\\needed to heal the Planet withered\\away the land__thenthe Planet__The\\Planet tried to\\persuade the Cetra to leave the\\Knowlespole, but__\\When the Cetra__\\were preparing to\\part with the land they loved__That's when it appeared!\\It looked like__our__our dead mothers\\__and our dead\\brothers. Showing\\us spectres of\\their past.\\ \\ \\ \\Gast: Who is the\\person that\\appeared at the\\North Cave? I\\haven't any idea.\\ \\ \\ \\Ifalna:That's\\when the one who\\injured the Planet\\__or the \"Crisis\\from the sky\" as wecall him, came.He\\first approached asa friend, deceived\\them, and finally__gave them the\\virus. The Cetra\\were attacked by\\the virus and went mad__transforming\\into monsters.\\Then, just as he\\had at the\\Knowlespole. He\\approached other\\Cetra clans__\\infecting them\\with__the virus__\\ \\ \\Gast: You don't\\look well__Let's\\call it a day.\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\Tape 2:\\What is Weapon?\\ \\ \\Gast: Ifalna, can\\you comment on the thing called\\Weapon?\\Ifalna: Yes,\\Professor. The one the Professor\\mistook for a\\Cetra__was named\\Jenova. That is the\"Crisis from the\\Sky\". The Planet\\knew it had to\\destroy the\\\"Crisis from the\\sky\" You see, as\\long as Jenova\\exists, the Planet will never be able to fully heal\\itself.\\ \\ \\ \\Gast: Back then,\\Weapon was a\\weapon the Planet\\produced of its ownwill?\\ \\ \\ \\Ifalna: Yes, but__\\There is no record of Weapon ever\\being used. A smallnumber of the\\surviving Cetra\\defeated Jenova andconfined it. The\\Planet produced\\Weapon__But it was no longer necessaryto use it. To this day Weapon remains asleep somewhere onthe Planet. Even\\though Jenova is\\confined, it could come back to life\\at some time__The\\Planet has not\\fully healed itselfyet. It is still\\watching Jenova.\\ \\Gast: Where is\\Weapon?\\ \\ \\Ifalna: I don't\\know__I can't hear the voice of the\\Planet well__Times\\__have changed. ThePlanet__is\\probably watching\\this situation\\closely.\\ \\ \\ \\Gast: __Thank you, Ifalna, that will\\be all for today.\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\Tape 3:\\Daughter's Record: 10th Day after\\birth\\Ifalna: What are\\you doing, Profes__I mean, honey?\\ \\Gast: Oh, I'm\\thinking of taping it on video. But,\\the video's not\\working right__\\ \\ \\ \\Ifalna: What are\\you going to tape? Is there still\\something I haven'tmentioned?\\ \\ \\ \\Gast: No, that's\\not it. I'm going\\to record my\\beautiful daughter.And when she's\\sleeping, her\\face__looks like anangel.\\Ifalna: First, we\\have to figure out her name. We can\\take the video\\later!\\ \\ \\ \\Gast: I've already decided! Her name\\will be Aerith.            \\That's that!\\ \\ \\ \\Ifalna: You are SO selfish! But Aerithis a good name!\\Hee hee__it's a\\good name,\\considering it cameout of that\\forgetful head of\\yours!\\ \\ \\ \\Gast: Right!? Oh,\\the video tape__\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\Tape 4:\\Daughter's Record: 20th Day after\\birth\\Ifalna: Video\\again? You just gotthrough taping!\\ \\Gast: __Please\\don't say it that\\way. It's our\\lovely daughter,\\both yours__and\\mine! Don't you\\want to capture herchildhood on\\videotape?\\ \\ \\ \\Ifalna: If you keepdoting on her like that, she won't\\grow up to be\\strong__Aerith is\\different from the other children. I\\wonder what dangersawait her__\\ \\ \\ \\Gast: Never say\\that! I will\\protect you and\\Aerith no matter\\what!! You and\\Aerith are my only treasures. I'll\\never let you go!!\\Ifalna: I feel so\\much better now,\\darling. If I\\hadn't met you, I____(Knock,Knock)\\ \\ \\ \\Gast: Who could\\that--! I was just about to__Damn!!\\How dare they\\intrude on our\\\"private time\"\\together!__I'll\\send them away.\\Ifalna: Yes, at\\once!!__Who the\\devil?\\ \\Gast: It, it's\\them!!\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\Hojo: Heh, heh, heh__I've been\\searching for you, Ifalna__or should\\I say, Cetra! Long time no see,\\Professor Gast!\\ \\Gast: Hojo__How didyou know?\\ \\ \\Hojo: Believe me, Ihad to turn over a stone or two to\\find you. Two\\years I waited__\\That's how much I\\wanted this new\\sample__Ha, ha, ha.Gast: __New sample?You don't mean\\Aerith!?\\ \\Hojo: Hmm, Aerith? What a nice\\name__Ha, ha, ha.\\ \\Gast: That's it!\\I'm severing all\\ties with the\\Shinra. Hojo,\\please leave.\\ \\ \\ \\Ifalna: Please,\\Aerith has nothing to do with it!\\All you want is\\me, right?\\ \\ \\ \\Gast: Ifalna!\\ \\ \\ \\Hojo: I'll need\\all of you for my\\experiment.  You\\understand, don't\\you, Professor\\Gast? We can changethe future of the\\Planet!\\Gast: Don't worry, Ifalna. I'll take\\care of this!\\ \\Hojo: Please don't put up a fight. I\\don't want any harmto come to my\\precious sample__\\Mmm? What a funny\\looking camera.\\Guard! Destroy it!\\__*Crash*\\(The video is out\\but sound can stillbe heard)\\Hojo: Be careful\\with her!! Ha, ha, ha__\\ \\Gast: Wh__what are you doing,\\Professor!?

12	1	47	64	49	Ha ha ha__Black\\Materia.Ha ha ha__\\Call Meteor.
12	1	48	64	52	Cloud!Get a hold ofyourself!
12	1	49	64	49	Cloud__I'm__Cloud__
12	1	50	64	49	How should I?
12	1	51	64	49	__I remember!I\\remember my way.
12	1	52	64	52	__Cloud.
12	1	53	64	49	Mm?What's wrong?Is\\something wrong?
12	1	54	64	52	__It's nothing so\\don't worry about\\it.
12	1	55	64	52	Right,Cloud!It's\\nothing.
12	1	56	64	52	Sephiroth got away.
12	1	57	64	49	__Don't worry aboutit.I understood\\what he was saying.
12	1	58	64	49	So this must be\\Meteor,right?
12	1	59	64	51	Is something going\\to fall from the\\sky?
12	1	60	64	52	__this must be\\magic.Just what\\Sephiroth was\\saying.
12	1	61	64	52	The Ultimate\\Destructive Magic,\\Meteor.It finds\\small drifting\\planets with its\\magic.
12	1	62	64	52	And then collides\\with them.This\\Planet might get\\wiped out\\entirely__
12	1	63	64	49	Sephiroth!?
12	1	64	64	60	Ha ha ha__It is notme.
12	1	65	64	49	What is this?
12	1	66	64	52	There's something\\written on it.
12	1	67	64	52	__B.l.a.c.k__M.a.t.e.r.i.a.
12	1	68	64	49	Black Materia?
12	1	69	64	52	Hey!__Black\\Materia.What shouldwe do,Cloud?
12	1	70	64	49	Shake it?
12	1	71	64	52	Wait a minute.I'll\\ask!
12	1	72	64	52	I don't\\understand__
12	1	73	64	52	What?Really?
12	1	74	64	52	They said that the\\Temple itself is\\the Black Materia.
12	1	75	64	49	What do they mean?
12	1	76	64	52	So,this whole\\building is the\\Black Materia?
12	1	77	64	49	This huge Temple?\\This is the Black\\Materia!?Then no\\one could take it.
12	1	78	64	52	Hmm,it's pretty\\hard.You see this\\is a model of the\\Temple.And inside\\it is a device,\\which gets smaller\\each time you solvea puzzle.As the\\model becomes\\smaller,you become\\smaller too.Until\\it's small enough\\to fit in the palm\\of your hand.
12	1	79	64	49	So,if we solve the\\puzzles,the Black\\Materia will get\\smaller and smallerand we can take it\\out?
12	1	80	64	52	Yes,but there's onething__You can onlyanswer puzzles\\inside the Temple.\\So,anyone who\\solves the puzzle\\will be crushed by\\the Temple.
12	1	81	64	49	I see__the Ancientsdidn't want\\dangerous magic to\\be taken out of theTemple so easily__
12	1	82	64	51	Let's just leave\\it,OK?
12	1	83	64	49	No.We've got to\\think of a way to\\get it out.Because\\Sephiroth has lots\\of different\\flunkies.It's\\nothing to him to\\throw their lives\\away to get the\\Black Materia.
12	1	84	64	49	This place isn't\\safe.
12	1	85	64	52	So what are we\\going to do?
12	1	86	64	54	Don't forget about\\me.Everything you\\said makes perfect\\sense!You can use\\my stuffed body forthe future of the\\Planet.
12	1	87	64	49	We can't let\\Sephiroth get his\\hands on the Black\\Materia.And we\\can't let the\\Shinra get theirs\\on it either.
12	1	88	64	54	But Cloud.There's\\really nothing elseyou can do.\\Everyone,please\\trust me.
12	1	89	64	49	I guess we have no\\choice.
12	1	90	64	54	All righty then!\\Leave it all to me!Please hurry,you'vegot to get out of\\there!I'll be\\waiting at the\\exit!
12	1	91	64	49	It's warm__
12	1	92	64	49	This isn't good__

12	1	100	64	52	Why don't you read\\our fortunes?
12	1	101	64	54	Say,that's right__Ihaven't done it in\\a while,huh?I'm so\\excited.Right or\\wrong,I'm still thesame 'ol me.Now,\\what should I\\predict?
12	1	102	64	52	Hmm,let's see how\\compatible Cloud\\and I are!
12	1	103	64	54	That'll cost ya.\\Exactly one date!
12	1	104	64	54	Here I go!
12	1	105	64	54	This isn't good.I\\can't say it.Poor\\Tifa.
12	1	106	64	52	No!Tell me!I\\promise I won't getmad!
12	1	107	64	54	Is that so?Then\\I'll tell you.Looksgood.You are\\perfect for each\\other!Aeris's star\\and Cloud's star!\\They show a great\\future!Cloud,I'll\\be your matchmaker,preacher__I'll do\\whatever you want\\me to!You just callme when it all\\happens!

12	1	109	64	52	Be strong CaitSith!

13	1	81	64	49	I only used to\\look up at your\\house from outside.
13	1	82	64	51	__that's right.We\\lived next to each\\other.But I really\\didn't know you\\that well.
13	1	83	64	49	you always used to be with that\\threesome.
13	1	84	64	51	__That's right.
13	1	85	64	49	I used to think__\\they were all\\stupid.
13	1	86	64	51	What?
13	1	87	64	49	You were all\\childish,laughing\\at every little\\stupid thing.\\__I know.I'm the\\one that was\\stupid.I really\\wanted to play witheveryone,but I was\\never allowed into\\the group.Then\\later__I began to\\think I was\\different from\\those immature\\kids.That then__\\maybe__Just maybe,\\they would invite\\me in.I thought\\that might happen,\\so I hung around__\\That night I calledyou out to the \\well__I thought to\\myself you would \\never come,that youhated me.
13	1	88	64	51	Yeah__it was so\\sudden.I was__a bitsurprised.But__It'strue that we\\weren't THAT close,but__After you lefttown,I really\\thought about you alot.I used to\\wonder how Cloud\\was doing.I wonder\\if Cloud was able\\to get into\\SOLDIER?I started\\reading the\\newspapers,thinkingthat there might bean article about\\you.
13	1	89	64	49	That was the first\\time I heard about\\Sephiroth.If I got\\strong like\\Sephiroth,then\\everyone might__If\\I could just get\\stronger__Then evenyou would have to \\notice me__
13	1	90	64	51	Cloud__
13	1	91	64	49	Uh__Tifa__
13	1	92	64	51	Oh,Cloud_!It's\\really you,isn't\\it?
13	1	93	64	49	Yeah__Tifa__We\\finally__meet\\again__
13	1	94	64	51	You stupid jerk!Youhad us all worried\\sick!
13	1	95	64	49	Krgh_!
13	1	96	64	51	Cloud!?Are you all\\right!?
13	1	97	64	50	Hey,uh,Tifa?\\don't like askin'\\this but__Is he\\really your\\childhood friend?\\And not Sephiroth'sshadow?
13	1	98	64	51	No,I'm sure of it!
13	1	99	64	50	Awright,I know__I\\shouldn't have\\doubted him.
13	1	100	64	51	I mean,I didn't\\really find him.\\Cloud found himselfon his own__
13	1	101	64	50	But,I can't win\\against you.You're\\some kinda lady.
13	1	102	64	51	People have so manythings pent up\\inside of\\themselves__And\\they can forget so\\many things__\\Strange__isn't it__
13	1	103	64	49	Everyone__
13	1	104	64	53	Don't say anything,Cloud.All you've\\been doing is\\apologizing.
13	1	105	64	49	I remeber every-\\thing now__I never was in SOLDIER.
13	1	106	64	51	But Cloud__how\\did you recall whathappened? You\\weren't there that day__
13	1	107	64	49	I became a guard\\employed by Shinra.After a few years\\I became friends\\with Zack, a 1st\\Class member of\\SOLDIER.I was latersent on a mission\\to accompany Zack\\and Sephiroth on a mission to\\Nibelheim to\\investigate the\\reactor.
13	1	108	64	51	Zack?Aeris's lost\\boyfriend?
13	1	109	64	49	I saw you,but I wasso ashamed,I\\couldn't show my\\face,I hid my\\identity from you__But I saw every-\\thing__I saw the\\reactor,saw\\Sephiroth fall intoa state of madness after learning of\\the Jenova Project and I witnessed\\Nibelheim burn. My mother,everyone,\\the whole town__.
13	1	110	64	49	After setting the\\town on fire,\\Sephiroth made his way to the reactor to get to Jenova__ Zack and I\\followed__.
13	1	111	64	49	Zack made his way\\to fight Sephiroth while I helped you in the reactor__ButZack was wounded bySephiroth__ Zack\\gave me his sword\\and told me to killSephiroth__ I ran\\into Jenova's room and stabbed\\Sephiroth__I then\\returned to you andZack.
13	1	112	64	49	Then I saw him,\\Sephiroth, limping away carrying the\\head of Jenova__I\\ran after him__He\\stabbed me with hissword, but somehow I was able to knockSephiroth off of\\the reactor bridge,where he plunged tohis death.
13	1	113	64	49	__I never was in\\SOLDIER.I created\\an illusion of\\myself made up of\\what I had seen in\\my life__and the\\stories Zack told\\me about his\\experiences in\\SOLDIER.And I\\continued to play\\the charade as if\\it were true.
13	1	114	64	50	Illusion,huh_?\\Pretty damn strong\\for a 'lusion,I'd\\say.
13	1	115	64	49	Zack and I were\\captured by Hojo inthe reactor, Zack\\and I were\\experimented on forseveral years__Zackbroke out of the\\capsule prison we\\were in and helped me escape with\\him__ We were\\hunted by Shinra\\troops, Zack was\\cornered and\\attacked by Shinra guards__I was in a haze and could not move or respond,\\so the guards let\\me be. When I was\\able to move again,I made my way to\\Zack, before he\\died, he gave me\\his sword. I was \\still in a daze\\from all of the\\experimentations,\\but I managed to \\make my way to\\Midgar where you\\found me, Tifa.
13	1	116	64	51	So that was it__\\Sorry,Cloud.If I\\had only rememberedmore clearly what\\had happened,I\\could have done\\something sooner__
13	1	117	64	49	It's not your\\fault,Tifa.
13	1	118	64	49	I'm physically\\built like someone\\on SOLDIER.Hojo's\\plan to clone\\Sephiroth wasn't\\that difficult.It\\was just the same\\procedure they use\\when creating\\members of SOLDIER.
13	1	119	64	49	You see,Someone in\\SOLDIER isn't\\simply exposed to\\Mako energy.Their\\bodies are actuallyinjected with\\Jenova cells__For\\better or for\\worse,only the\\strong can enter\\SOLDIER.It has\\nothing to do with\\the Jenova Reunion.But weak people__\\like me,get lost inthe whole thing.
13	1	120	64	49	The combination of\\Jenova cells,\\Sephiroth's strong\\will,and my own\\weaknesses are whatcreated me.Everyoneknew that.I'm__\\Cloud.
13	1	121	64	50	That means there\\ain't no differencefrom before!?
13	1	122	64	55	Sephiroth went intothe Lifestream!
13	1	123	64	49	It's like you\\always told me,\\Barret.
13	1	124	64	53	Oh,uh,you mean\\that!
13	1	125	64	54	Meteor's been\\summoned, it may\\be too late__
